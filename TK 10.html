    <h2>Dolphins vs. Bills Overview</h2>
    <body>
    <p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">The first interesting game will be the Miami Dolphins away at the Bills. This Thursday night game should be a close one, with two competitive teams facing off. The weather in Buffalo should not have an impact on the game for once, projected in the 80s. Both teams are coming off wins in the opening week, but this will ultimately be a battle of the quarterbacks. Allen is coming off of a 137.7 quarterback rating last year, Tagovailoa with a 101.1. After a phenomenal game last week, Tyreek Hill will also be a main factor in deciding the outcome of this game. To combat him, the Bills have an astounding multi-faceted player Taron Johnson. The safeties of the Bills may have issues facing "the cheetah", but with a whole new season, who knows what could happen! This will surely be a fierce faceoff that will have fans on the edge of their seats, even though this season is jsut beginning.

    <h2>Chiefs vs. Bengals Overview</h2>
    <p><p style="text-indent: 20px;">
       The Kansas City Chiefs will have their second home game of the season, looking for another win. After a disappointing upset with the Patriots, the Bengals are looking to come out strong and gain some momentum into this season. Agarin, the quarterbacks will be huge in this game! Mahomes started out with a strong 291 yards in last weeks game, Burrow topping him with 317, but also had an interception. Kansas City should provide no wether issues except for maybe some "Cruel Summer" patterns, being in the high 80s. Oh and that's right! Taylor Swift is rumored to attend after her amazing wins at the VMAs. Perhaps with that excitement, Travis Kelce will be a bit more beneficial than in opening week with only 34 yards. Sunday will hold a lot of great football and the Chiefs at home with the bengals will certainly be a main part of that.
